# nvim config

I use [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) with some tweaks to suit my needs.

## Prerequisites

- nvim (duh)
- stow
- fd
- lazygit
- rg
- fzf

Maybe more I'm not even sure lol

## Installation

Clone this repo to your root directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yangavin/neovim.git ~/neovim
```

Symlink the neovim directory with stow:

```bash
cd ~/neovim
stow home
```

## Custom branch

Before LazyVim, I also have my own neovim configuration.
You can find it in the `custom` branch.
